# Module Integration Reference

This document provides reference materials for how the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module integrates with previous modules.

## Integration with Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

The VLA module builds on ROS 2 concepts for:
- Robot communication and control
- Action execution through ROS 2 action sequences
- Message passing between VLA components

## Integration with Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

The VLA module leverages digital twin concepts for:
- Simulation environments to test VLA behaviors
- Sensor simulation for vision components
- Safe testing of voice-commanded robot actions

## Integration with Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

The VLA module incorporates AI-Robot Brain concepts for:
- Perception-action loops
- Cognitive planning using AI systems
- Navigation and path planning integration
